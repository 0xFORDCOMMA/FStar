(*type lambdas in a definitions should be moved leftward and made a definition *)
type sch1 : (Type  ->  Type) = fun (x:Type) ->  (x ->  Tot x)

(*again, too this differs from both options presented in the thesis. *)
type sch3 : (nnat  ->  Type) -> Type  = fun (x:(nnat  ->  Type)) ->  (x O) ->  Tot (x (S O))

(* manual parametrization, now it extracts to his second (preferred) option *)
type sch3param (x:(nnat  ->  Type))  =  (x O) ->  Tot (x (S O))


(*things that dont work:*)

type idt =  (x:Type) ->  (x ->  Tot x)

(*
Minor changes are required to make it work.
The idea is that nnat becomes unit.
Inuitively, vec now becomes a union of all members of the family *)

type vec (a:Type) : nnat -> Type =
| Nill : vec a O
| Conss : n:nnat -> a ->  (vec a n) -> vec a (S n)

type vecn1 = vec nnat (S O)

type naryTree (t:Type) (n:nnat) =
| Leaf : naryTree t n
| Node : vec (naryTree t n) n -> (naryTree t n)


type binaryTree (t:Type) = naryTree t (S (S O))

(* The last stage may also need to apply units to arguments of type Type.
   In Coq, the last argument of vec disappers, so this might not be a problem
 *)
type polyvec = poly (vec nnat)

(* This is even more complicated. what does Coq do about it?
   What it does is similar to the above case. Instead of applying unit (to vec),
   it applies  Obj.t (to list).

  Perhaps the general theme is that we retain type parameters, even
    if they have type other than Type.
  Indeed, while translating type type abbreviations or inductive types,
  we just copy the list of binders and dont even look at the types of binders.

  Of course, after the translation, all binders have type Type.
  So, one has to be careful while instantiating those binders.
  In particular, one has to apply more arguments before instantiating.
  If the arguments are terms, unit should usually work, because
  term-dependencies are removed in type definitions.

  In case the arguments are types, Obj.t seems to be the only thing that
  can be cooked from thin air, and it is what Coq seems to be doing.
  Is this mentioned somewhere in the thesis?

  All this seems a bit arbitrary, although is perhaps inspired by some
  use cases in Coq, and had been heavily tested (in Coq).
  Yet, Why is this the right way, conceptually?
