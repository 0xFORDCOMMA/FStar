The implementation for examples from the `Dijkstra Monads for Free'
paper can be found in this directory. Here is an index for them. Each
file contains comments and should be self-contained, but we recommend to
follow this order when trying to familiarize oneself with the feature.

Section		Description			File

§ 2.2           Integer state (incr example)    FStar.DM4F.IntST.fst
-- CH: alternatively, obtain this by instantiating ST below
       also incr_increases would need to be copied
§ 2.3		Simple state monad (st)		FStar.DM4F.ST.fst
-- this is more general than in the paper (parameterized over state type)

§ 2.5		Exception (exn)			FStar.DM4F.Exceptions.fst
§ 2.5		State+Exception (stexn)		FStar.DM4F.StExn.fst
§ 2.5		Exception+State (exnst)		FStar.DM4F.ExnSt.fst
§ 2.5		Exception-counting (stexnC)	FStar.DM4F.StExnC.fst

§ 2.x           Proving monad and lift laws     Effects.Def.fst
-- TODO: If #710 stays move all our monad proofs to this file using Tot

§ 2.6		Information-flow (IFC)		FStar.DM4F.IntST.fst (extrinsic)
                                                FStar.DM4F.IFC.fst (LIO example)

§ 2.7		Continuations (cont)            FStar.DM4F.Continuations.fst
-- our implementation is not yet able to deal with this
