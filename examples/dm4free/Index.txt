The implementation for examples from the `Dijkstra Monads for Free'
paper can be found in this directory. Here is an index for them. Each
file contains comments and should be self-contained, but we recommend to
follow this order when trying to familiarize oneself with the feature.

Section		Description			File

§ 2.2           Integer state (incr example)    FStar.DM4F.IntST.fst
-- CH: alternatively, obtain this by instantiating ST below
       also incr_increases would need to be copied
§ 2.3		Simple state monad (st)		FStar.DM4F.ST.fst
-- this is more general than in the paper (parameterized over state type)
-- TODO: (2.3 mentions the laws, what about that?)

§ 2.5		Exception (exn)			FStar.DM4F.Exceptions.fst
§ 2.5		State+Exception (stexn)		FStar.DM4F.StExn.fst
§ 2.5		Exception+State (exnst)		FStar.DM4F.ExnSt.fst
§ 2.5		Exception-counting (stexnC)	FStar.DM4F.StExnC.fst

§ 2.x           Proving monad and lift laws     Effects.Def.fst

-- REVIEW:
§ 2.6		Information-flow (IFC)		ifc.fst and ifcEffect.fst
-- tried to do the extrinsic part at the end of IntST, but failed
§ 2.7		Continuations (cont)		?

TODO: make sure all these files are part of the build in the end
