	Low*			<--->			C

Coding restrictions:
- code is first order
- No variable shadowing, hence if a var name is reused it must be of the same type
  and overwritten in the following code

Library functions for buffer manipulation:

let x = SBuffer.create #size init len in		~>	uint{size} x[len] = {0};
SBuffer.index #size b idx    	      	 		~>	b[idx]
SBuffer.upd #size b idx v;		 		~> 	b[idx] = v;
SBuffer.sub #size b idx len		 		~> 	(b+idx)
SBuffer.offset #size b idx				~>	(b+idx)
SBuffer.blit #size src src_idx dest dest_idx len	~>	memcpy (dest+dest_idx) (src+src_idx) ((((size+1) / 8) * len)



(*** OLD NOTES ***)
Low*

The Low* variant of low-level memory management for F* aims at ellaborating
a subset of F* programs into an RST program where no memory management is left
to a garbage collector.
The user can chose to allocate on the heap for long-lived references, or on the
top of the stack. All implicit allocations are put in the topmost region of the
stack.

Our goal is to isolate a subset of F* such that it is safe to do so.

For now we consider that we are in the fragment which is:
- first order (need of defunctionalization / closure conversion)
- monomorphic after specialization (whole program compilation with no polymorphism
  left after erasure)

Eventually Low* would use:
- erasure
- inlining
- defunctionalization
- monomorphization
- clever choice of type representation

1 -  Variant of RST which opts in for stack allocation.

The current RST monad uses is an "opt-out" version of low-level manual
memory management:
- a single region as the global, manually managed heap
- a stack of regions as the manually managed stack:
  -> regions are push and pop manually
  -> references are manually allocated in the topmost region of this stack
- the OCaml runtime handles all implicit allocations in its garbage collected
  heap

Low* intends to remove entirely the garbage collection, hence making memory
management entirely manual. It is an "opt-in" version of the low-level memory
management:
- a single region as the global, manually managed heap
- a stack of regions as the manually managed stack
  -> regions are automatically pushed and popped for non-inlined functions
  -> references can be manually allocated in the topmost region of this
     stack
- all implicits allocations are made in the topmost region of the stack

Everything is  allocated on the stack unless specified otherwise: opt-in
stack allocation strategy, no garbage collection.
Fresh value are considered as locals.

It implies restrictions on the types allowed in this subset: recursive types
must have a reference seperating two recursion steps.
Ie: type list 'a = | Nil | Cons: 'a -> list 'a -> list 'a is forbidden
    type list 'a = | Nil | Cons: 'a -> ref (list 'a) -> list 'a is allowed


Systematic push/pop of stack frames in functions - abstract indexes for regions

The back-end requires that for each function that is not inlined,
a new stack frame be pushed, and popped before returning the result.
E.g.:
     f x -> e
     
     goes to

     f' x = PushStackFrame(); let r = e in PopStackFrame(); r

All the allocations in the new frame are no longer dereferencable when the frame
is popped.

Region indexes are kept abstract to prevent comparison between arbitraty region indexes,
as well as two prevent that two seperately created regions (frames) share the same index:
once the region in which a reference has been allocated is popped, that reference must
never be dereferencable again.

Located references (from RST)

"located" is the term currently used in RST (formerly SST).
A reference can only be allocated:
- on the heap
- on the top frame of the stack

Before dereferencing, the user has to show that the reference is live.
Hence it is only possible to deference references allocated at the same level or below the
current stack frame.

Calling conventions

Low* implies specialization either up to fully instantiated types or type classes.
This specialization must allow the compiler to optimize the type reprensentation for
each object and each function.

In Low*:

  - the arguments can be passed:
    - by value
    - by reference if the value is big OR the value is mutable

  - The results are passed by values
    -> an additional transformation makes it return by reference:
    let f x: t = e ~> let f' x (p:ref t) = 
		       	   let r = e in
		       	   p := r



    In RST: let (v:'a) = f () ~> return_by_ref f = 
       	     	       	     	      let ret_addr = salloc (instanceOf 'a) in
				      pushStackFrame();
				      let v = f () in
				      memwrite ret_addr v;
				      popStackFrame();
				      memread ret_addr

This should be safe provided that there is no aliasing issue with the new reference that is introduced, and
that the function 'f' is still typechecking in the environment of the new stack.

// TODO: write the combinator, make sure it is safe

  - Assignment to locally allocated values is
    - by value
    - by reference is fine as long as dereferencement is forbidden if the reference is not
      live

The calling convention is decided AFTER monomorphization on a function signature by function
signature basis:
-> Different specializations of the same function can have different calling conventions.

For "small" values, the C compiler is expected to make the appropriate choices to reduce
the concrete number of copies.
-> Concrete experimental results are needed // TODO

The programmer should have a way to specify that she wants to have a certain convention
and prevent the back-end from modifying it.

Inlining

Pure functions should be inlined (all potential allocations are local and should not influence
the rest of the computation in any way).


Functions not pushing/popping stack frames are to be inlined.
-> After the F* to F* phase all remaining functions should have the push/pop discipline,
   intuitively corresponding to the C discipline.


Arrays

New Low* (F*?) library to represent arrays with pointer arithmetic :

val Array.length: #a:Type -> array a -> GTot nat
val Array.create: r:region_id{ r is top frame on the stack } -> length:nat -> init_value:a -> StaticSST array a 
val Array.read: #a:Type -> t:array{ is_live t } -> idx:nat{ is_within_range idx t } -> StaticSST a
val Array.write: #a:Type -> t:array a{ is_live t } -> idx:nat{ is_within_range idx t } -> v:a -> StaticSST unit
val Array.inner: #a:Type -> t:array a -> idx:nat -> length:nat{ is_within_range (idx+length) a } -> StaticSST (t':array a{  (is_live t ==> is_live t') /\ Array.length t' = length })

This should allow us to efficiently implement programs such as crypto or asynchronous I/O.

Recursive data types

The programmer is responsible for making sure that all defined recursive datatypes are embedded
in references, ie between two recursive occurences of the type there must be a reference somewhere.
E.g.:
   type list 'a = option(ref (_list 'a))
   and _list 'a = 'a * list 'a

Compilation will fail if some recursive data types do not satisfy this condition after the
monomorphisation phase.


Remarks:
- References are isomorphic to arrays of size 1:
  ref (r_id) 'a ~ array (r_id) 'a 1


Future work
- formalization of Low*

- build consistent library for low-level programming, e.g.
  - system calls
  - infix pointers
  - interop with other libraries (openSSL...)

- Work on type / semantic preservation for the different phases

- Benchmarking
  - performance of different type representations
  - miTLS IO
  - crypto
