Build wizardry
--------------

There are two lexers:
- [ml/lex.mll] (building F* via OCaml extraction)
- [lex.fsl] (building F* with F#)

The former bundles everything lexing-related into a single file. The latter has
a companion file [lexhelp.fs] that contains various routines.

There is one parser, [parse.fsy], used for building F* with F#. When extracting
F* to OCaml using F*, [parse.fsy] is run through some sed-foo in
[ocaml-output/Makefile] in order to produce a valid, ocamlyacc-compatible
[parse.mly].

Adding a new token
------------------

If you're adding a new token, you need to edit:
- [parse.fsti] the token datatype (building F* with F* via OCaml extraction)
- [parse.fsi] the token datatype (building F* with F#)
- [lexhelp.fs] to add it to the parser keyword table (F#)
- [ml/lex.mll] to add it to the parser keyword table (OCaml)
- [parse.fsy] to expose it to the parser, possibly with an adequate precedence
