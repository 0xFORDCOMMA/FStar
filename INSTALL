Prerequisites for building F* from sources (work in progress)

Windows
  any particular flavour?

Z3 4.3? from http://z3.codeplex.com/
32bit version will do fine?
Copy libz3.dll, Microsoft.Z3.dll, and z3.exe to the bin directory.
  Any other file (e.g. the .pyc files)?

Make 3.81? With Cygwin? Any other unix tool needed?
  Tried Microsoft's nmake but it didn't like the syntax

[optional?] Visual Studio ????
  Which version? I tried opening fstar.fsproj with Visual Studio 2010
  and got that "This project is incompatible with the current version
  of Visual Studio"
