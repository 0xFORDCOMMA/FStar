Prerequisites for building F* from sources (work in progress)

At the moment:

  On Windows 8 with .NET framework 4.5 and F# v2.0 :

     -- You need at least Z3 version 4.1. Later versions should be
        fine, but have not been tested.

        Copy z3.exe, z3.dll and Microsoft.Z3.dll into FStar/bin
        
        By default, F* uses the 64-bit versions. But, you should also
        be able to use the 32 bit versions by passing the flag
        --platform:x86 to fsc.
     
     Then either: 

          Using VisualStudio 2012, open FStar/VS/FStar.sln and build
          solution.

          Or, with Cygwin's GNU make (4.0), run "make" from FStar/src

  Also, can be built using Mono (Pierre-Yves?)
